I dislike the lack of colour and style of this website. It seems very plain but it has
decent responsive layout with different screen sizes.

I dislike the lack of colour and the link colours of this website. The contact us button is very
well done though and has slick media styles for music.

This website looks amazing from the background to the slick layout of the contact us form and 
social media share buttons. I also like the layout of the music media and the responsive design
when you shrink the screen size.
